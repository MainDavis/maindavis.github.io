This channel serves as an operations log. It documents technical decisions, deployments, and security notes that affect the public environment.

The goal is to keep a clear line: what gets published must be useful, verifiable, and direct. If an entry does not add context or a concrete action, it does not get published.

In the next entries, we will add:

- Status of active projects
- Version change summaries
- Installation and usage guides

## Frequently asked questions

**What scenarios is it designed for?**  
Labs and explicitly authorized operations where low footprint is required.

**Does it include payloads or exploits?**  
No. The goal is to document the flow and architecture in controlled contexts.

**Can I use it in production?**  
Only with explicit permission and approved procedures. Prefer test environments.

**Why Nim?**  
It provides low-level control with modern syntax and enables compile-time obfuscation.

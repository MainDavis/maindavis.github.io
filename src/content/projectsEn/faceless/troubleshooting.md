Common issues:

- **Limited execution**: check session privileges and environment permissions.
- **Missing dependencies**: confirm Nim version and winim package.
- **Target not found**: validate PID or exact process name.

Quick checklist:

1. Build succeeds and binary is generated.
2. Controlled environment with appropriate permissions.
3. Valid, accessible target.

If issues persist, review your lab logs and adjust the flow to a safe testing scenario.

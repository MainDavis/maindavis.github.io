## Context

Faceless is designed for **research and authorized testing** on Windows systems. It prioritizes low-noise execution and a clean architecture with well-defined components.

## Scope

- Controlled operations in labs or explicitly authorized environments
- Emphasis on reproducibility, validation, and documentation
- Avoids external dependencies and unnecessary noise

## Goals

It is not a general-purpose framework. The focus is a specific chain: enumeration, target selection, token impersonation, and execution under elevated context.
